I set up a meeting with my project partner Yalla Let's Talk, on November 29. We talked about my suggestions and ideas and also their expectations for the new website. To sum up, they wanted a more visual and colorful website, and connect the main page with their other project's website. I asked them to send me pictures of their events and information about their team. I got the files that I need on December 4. Consequently, I will start to make the front-end part.
